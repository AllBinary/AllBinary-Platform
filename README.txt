The AllBinary Platform represents more than 10 years of development and > 1 million LOC.  Some of which is represented by the this repo info: https://www.ohloh.net/p/AllBinary-Platform

What is the goal?

The goal of the AllBinary Platform is to create a Self Replicating Robot Army 
dedicated to protecting, building, and maintaining Open Source Space Ships to escape the 
tyrants of Earth.

What is still needed to obtain the Self Replicating Robot Army?

: MMORTS - For the control of robots based on my ZeptoWars RTS game
: Resource Collection API 
: 3D Printer API
: Convert existing Open Robots for the 3D printer API
: Convert existing Open Resource Machines for the 3D Printer API - mainly smelting, ore separation, extrusion material formation

After the Self Replicating Robot Army is created what is needed for the Open Source Space Ships?

: Parts Development using all off the self technologies for the following APIs in order of need:
: Environmental Control/Life Support - Oxygen, Temperature, Gravity, and other Controls and Sensors
: Defense
: Propulsion
: Navigation
: Repair
: Communications

What is the Current Version?

1.2.0

What is the License?

Please see the LICENSE file in the root of the repository.

What is the AllBinary InputAutomationTool Solution? 

It speeds up application testing by providing a base framework for automating input.
: C/C++ DLLs for human input device hooks
: OSGI plug-ins

Future Implementation for the AllBinary Platform:

More Social stuff
More Plaform Support - ActionScript and Native output
Integrated and highly customizable Scene Editor - I currently use a several 3d 
tools as scene/model editors
Robotics Integration - RTS with real robots and real map integration
MDA Integration - Probably won't ever happen but I would like to have an MDA tool 
that speeds development.  Not that Eclipse and NetBeans aren't great.
