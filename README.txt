What is the goal?

The goal of the AllBinary Platform is to create a Self Replicating Robot Army 
dedicated to protecting, building, and maintaining Open Source Space Ships to escape the 
tyrants of Earth.

What is still needed to obtain the Self Replicating Robot Army?

: MMORTS - For the control of robots based on my ZeptoWars RTS game
: Resource Collection API 
: 3D Printer API
: Convert existing Open Robots for the 3D printer API
: Convert existing Open Resource Machines for the 3D Printer API - mainly smelting, ore separation, extrusion material formation

After the Self Replicating Robot Army is created what is needed for the Open Source Space Ships?

: Parts Development using all off the self technologies for the following APIs in order of need:
: Environmental Control/Life Support - Oxygen, Temperature, Gravity, and other Controls and Sensors
: Defense
: Propulsion
: Navigation
: Repair
: Communications

What is the Current Version?
