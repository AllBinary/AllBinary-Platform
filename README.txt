What is the AllBinary InputAutomationTool Solution? 

It speeds up application testing by providing a base framework for automating input.
: C/C++ DLLs for human input device hooks
: OSGI plug-ins

Future Implementation for the AllBinary Platform:

Better integration with GDevelop - https://github.com/AllBinary/AllBinary-Platform-Game-With-GDevelop

3D/OpenGLES mappings for WebGL to deploy 3d games in browsers.

Multiplayer for platforms other than J2ME, Android, Avian, and J2SE.

Social API integration and improvements

Integration with other Scene Editors, 2d/3d animation tools (currently Spline), and other graphics tools.

Robotics Integration API, 3D Printer Integration API and Resource Collection API - RTS with real robots and real maps

What is still needed to obtain the Self Replicating Robot Army to start building Space Ships?

: MMORTS - For the control of robots based on my ZeptoWars RTS game
: Resource Collection API 
: 3D Printer API
: Convert existing Open Robots for the 3D printer API
: Convert existing Open Resource Machines for the 3D Printer API - mainly smelting, ore separation, extrusion material formation

After the Self Replicating Robot Army is created what is needed for the Space Ships?

: Parts Development using all off the self technologies for the following APIs in order of need:
: Environmental Control/Life Support - Oxygen, Temperature, Gravity, and other Controls and Sensors
: Defense
: Propulsion
: Navigation
: Repair
: Communications
